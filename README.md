# Experiments

1. anti_symmetric_normal_weight_test.ipynb
 * Comparison of normal and anti_symmetric normal
 * anti_sym converges faster.
 
2. anti_symmetric_normal_diagonal_test.ipynb
 * There is an appropriate value for hyperparameter gamma. 
 * If this value is good enough, different values of gamma shows quite similar convergence ratio.
 
3. anti_symmetric_normal_backprogation_analysi
 * Not implemented yet.
